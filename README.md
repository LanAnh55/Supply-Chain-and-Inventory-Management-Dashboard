# Supply-Chain-and-Inventory-Management-Dashboard

Prepared by: Nguyễn Thị Lan Anh 

Tool used: Tableau Desktop

Data sources: SQL Database 

Purpose: Track and improve inventory performance across warehouses

# I. PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In today’s fast-moving supply chain, businesses must manage inventory carefully to avoid:

•	Stock-outs that affect customer service and revenue

•	Overstock that wastes money and warehouse space

•	Poor stock coverage that leads to last-minute purchases and inefficiencies

To solve these problems, the Inventory Management Dashboard was created. Its main goals are:

•	Monitor current stock levels across products and locations

•	Identify shortages (under safety stock) and overstock situations

•	Forecast stock needs and predict future stock-outs

•	Compare performance across warehouses

•	Help managers make better, data-driven decisions

# II. DASHBOARD STRUCTURE
The Tableau file includes:

6 main dashboards: Availability, Excess Stock, Missing Stock, Stock Coverage, Warehouses, Storytelling

•	Over 50 worksheets with charts, KPIs, trends, and calculations

• Data sources from SQL DATABASE 

# III. KEY ANALYSIS 

1. Availability – Current Inventory Status
   
• Shows product categories by stock condition: safe, overstocked, low, or critical

• Compares available stock across warehouses

• Uses bar charts, evolution graphs, and KPIs

2. Excess Stock – Overstock Tracking
   
• Highlights products with stock above demand or safety level

• Tracks the value and trend of overstock over time

• Includes Pareto chart and performance bars to focus on top issues

3. Missing Stock – Low & Out-of-Stock Items
   
• Finds products below safety stock or running out

• Predicts next stock-out periods using forecast data

• Provides line charts, indicators, and stock-out alerts

4. Stock Coverage – Inventory Forecasting
   
• Estimates how many days stock can cover future demand

• Helps with planning and reordering schedules

• Works with average consumption and forecast logic

5. Warehouses – Location Comparison
